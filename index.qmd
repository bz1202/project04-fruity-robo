## Project Overview

This project analyzes the **commercial success factors** of video games on Steam, the world's largest digital PC gaming marketplace.  Using data from 28,017 games, we explore: 

- **Pricing & Discount Strategies** - How do pricing decisions impact success?
- **Genre & Tag Clustering** - Which game types share similar outcomes?
- **Temporal Patterns** - Are there seasonal release patterns?
- **Publisher Effects** - Do large publishers systematically outperform indies?

## Key Findings

### The "Success Formula" Decoded

| Cluster | Profile | Key Insight |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Cluster 3** | Evergreen Hits | Action-focused, multiplayer games dominate long-term popularity |
| **Cluster 5** | Premium Titles | Narrative-rich experiences justify higher price points ($20+) |
| **Cluster 2** | Indie Gems | High ratings through unique mechanics, avoiding action tropes |
| **Cluster 1** | Shovelware | High action but low narrative = poor reception |

### Market Insights

- **Premium games** show higher median CCU, contradicting the assumption that cheaper = more popular
- **Deep discounts (>75%)** are used by already successful titles, not as a growth strategy
- **Positive review share peaks** at moderate playtime levels (satisfaction "sweet spot")
